# Expandmode

Display Additional mode on category page same like "list" and "grid" mode.

I have create a custom mode as "expand" mode.

After installing extension you need to make admin changes to display three modes on category list page.

Store >> Configuration >> Catalog >> Storefront >> List Mode select as "Expand (default) / List / Grid"

Clear cache and you can see additional mode on category listing page.
